# Authentication API (In Dev.)

## Description

This API service offers a secure and hassle-free authentication solution for your applications. By integrating this API, developers can easily register users, verify user credentials, change passwords, and delete users, all without the need to store user credentials locally or defining any logic for authentication. The API returns a unique ID for each registered user, simplifying user management. To use this service, simply pull the Docker image from DockerHub, provide the required environment variables for the database, and use a PostgreSQL 13 image along with the application image. Use this API to streamline user authentication in your applications, while ensuring the security of user credentials.
