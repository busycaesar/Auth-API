# Auth APIs

## Description
The Auth APIs is designed to simplify authentication across all your projects. Instead of writing the same code for user login and JWT handling every time you start a new project, you can rely on this service to take care of it for you. The Auth APIs offers ready-to-use endpoints for registering users, verifying credentials, changing passwords, and deleting users. It also generates and verifies JWT tokens, making it easier to secure user sessions. Passwords are stored in a hashed format, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure.

This setup saves you a lot of time and ensures that your authentication is secure and consistent across all your apps. With the Auth APIs, you can focus more on building your appâ€™s core features and less on the complexities of setting up and managing authentication.

Even though this service handles the heavy lifting of authentication, all data is stored locally on your machine, giving you full control over your users' data. You get the convenience of a ready-made solution while keeping your data completely secure.
