# Authentication API

## Description

This API service provides developers with a simple way to handle user authentication in their applications. It offers ready-to-use APIs for registering users, verifying credentials, changing passwords, and deleting users, eliminating the need to write and manage authentication logic for each application. The service also generates and verifies JWT tokens, making it easier to secure user sessions. With a fully contained Docker image, you don’t need to manage a separate PostgreSQL instance—just pull the image, set up the required environment variables, and start authenticating users with minimal effort.
